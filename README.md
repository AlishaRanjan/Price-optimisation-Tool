# Price Optimization Tool

## Overview

The **Price Optimization Tool** is a web application designed to help businesses optimize their pricing strategies. It enables users to manage product data, forecast demand trends, and receive optimized pricing recommendations based on market conditions and demand forecasts. The tool integrates advanced functionalities while ensuring ease of use and high performance.

## Key Features

### Product Management

- Users can **create, update, delete**, and **view products** with essential details such as:
  - Name
  - Category
  - Cost price
  - Selling price
  - Stock
  - Units sold
- **Advanced search and filter** functionalities are provided for efficient product management.

### Demand Forecasting

- Users can **view and analyze demand forecasts** for products.
- Demand is represented visually using **linear plots** (demand vs selling price).

### Pricing Optimization

- The tool provides **optimized pricing recommendations** for each product based on input data.
- Optimized prices are displayed in a **tabular format** with product details.

### User Authentication and Authorization

- Secure **user registration and login**
- **Role-based access control** (admin, buyer, supplier, and custom roles) ensures appropriate access levels for users.

## Goal

To provide businesses with a comprehensive, intuitive tool that facilitates **data-driven pricing decisions**, improving pricing strategies and market competitiveness.

## My Approach and Understanding

### Initial Understanding:

Upon reviewing the project requirements, my understanding was that the primary objective was to build a **Price Optimization Tool** that helps businesses manage product data, forecast demand trends, and implement optimized pricing strategies. This would be accomplished by integrating multiple components, such as product management, demand forecasting, and pricing optimization, into a seamless web application.

### Development Process:

1. **Product Management Module**:

   - **Product CRUD Operations**: The first step was to implement the product management module, where users could create, read, update, and delete products. This involved designing a product model in the backend (using Django or FastAPI) with fields such as product name, category, cost price, selling price, stock, and units sold. I focused on ensuring data integrity and built API endpoints for handling product operations.
   - **Search and Filter**: I incorporated advanced search functionality to allow users to filter products based on criteria such as name and category. This functionality was added on frontend.

2. **Demand Forecasting**:

   - The **demand forecasting module** required integrating a visualization component where users could view demand trajectories. I researched different charting libraries and chose **Chart.js** for its simplicity and ease of integration with React.

3. **Pricing Optimization**:
   - The **pricing optimization module** was designed to provide product pricing recommendations. The optimized prices were displayed in a tabular format.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**:

   - As part of ensuring security and user management, I implemented **user authentication** and **role-based access control**. The system allows different users (admin, buyer, supplier) to have access to different parts of the application, ensuring that the right user roles are given appropriate permissions.

5. **Technological Considerations**:
   - I chose **Django** for the backend as it provides strong features for rapid development, security, and scalability. I used **PostgreSQL** for database management to handle relational data efficiently. On the front end, I implemented **React.js** for building a responsive, dynamic user interface that communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

## Backend Setup

### Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

## `python -m venv env`

## `source env/bin/activate`

or

## `nv\Scripts\activate` Use this for windows

### Install Required Packages

## `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Database Setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database

## `psql -U postgres`

## `CREATE DATABASE price_optimization`

2. Update the database connection settings in your settings.py

DATABASES = {
'default': {
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
'NAME': 'price_optimization',
'USER': 'your_postgres_username',
'PASSWORD': 'your_postgres_password',
'HOST': 'localhost',
'PORT': '5432',
}
}

### Run Migrations

## `python manage.py migrate`

### Run the Server

## `python manage.py runserver`

## Frontend Setup

### Install Dependencies

## `npm install`

or

## `yarn install`

### Running the Development Server

## `npm start`

or

## `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
